# NIST TN 1822 — JuPedSim verification scenarios

Scenarios and notebooks based on **NIST Technical Note 1822** (Ronchi,
Kuligowski, Reneke, Peacock, Nilsson, 2013 — *The process of verification and
validation of building fire evacuation models*). Reference:
<https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/technicalnotes/NIST.TN.1822.pdf>.

Notebooks live alongside this README; scenario ZIPs live in
`scenario_files/`; parameter-sweep helpers live in `scenario_builders/`;
reference data lives in CSVs at this folder's root.

\* **Verif.2.9** and **Verif.5.2** run and produce trajectories, but their one
NIST numeric criterion needs a `CollisionFreeSpeedModel` capability the model
lacks, so each is a strict `xfail` (see issue #151):
- Verif.2.9 expects Group 1 to reach the exit together (arrival spread ≤ 10 s).
  There is no native group-cohesion model, so the 0.5 m/s member lags the
  1.25 m/s members (spread ~24 s). The original config's custom `group_id`
  parameter was stripped during cleaning.
- Verif.5.2 (emergent-flow reading of NIST §3.1.5) expects the sustained
  specific flow through the 1 m exit to stay under the IMO 1.33 p/m/s
  reference. There is no door-flow limiter, so the emergent flow (~5 p/m/s)
  exceeds it.

## Modification highlights vs NIST originals

See [`MODIFICATIONS.md`](MODIFICATIONS.md) for the full audit trail. Summary:

- **Exit-capture polygon thickness** normalised to 0.3 m across every scenario
  for consistency with `Nist-1-1-premovement.zip`. The exit opening width
  (along the wall) follows the NIST figures unchanged.
- **Single-agent speed tests** (Verif.2.1, 2.2, 2.5) extend the corridor or
  stair by 10 m at each end (upstream acceleration buffer + downstream
  isolation buffer). The measurement segment length remains exactly as NIST
  specifies.
- **Verif.3.1 (S12)** geometry was rebuilt to NIST Figure 8 (12 rooms around a
  1 m corridor + vestibule); the previous tree had a bare 18 m x 11 m
  rectangle. Population is **13 agents** (one per room, plus one). NIST TN 1822
  §3.1.3 says "23 persons", but that is a typo in the guideline — the Figure 8
  layout has 12 rooms, so 13 is the faithful count. The allocation split
  (8 rooms → main exit, 4 → secondary) matches the standard.
- **Verif.5.2 (S17)** uses the emergent-flow non-exceedance interpretation of
  NIST §3.1.5, because the JuPedSim CollisionFreeSpeedModel has no built-in
  door-flow limiter. The 1.33 p/m/s value (IMO MSC/Circ.1238) is a post-run
  comparison threshold, not an input cap applied to the exit.
- **Terminology**: "pre-evacuation time" used throughout in place of mixed
  "pre-movement / immediate response / instant response / response time 0"
  wording from earlier V&V iterations. NIST TN 1822 uses "pre-evacuation
  time" as the canonical term.
- **Schema cleanup**: every `config.json` has been filtered to canonical
  JuPedSim-scenarios loader fields (verified against
  `src/jupedsim_scenarios/simulation_init.py` and
  `rimea/scenario_files/rimea-12d-bottleneck/config.json`). Custom non-loader
  keys (`group_id`, `room_number`, `desired_speed_distribution`,
  `desired_speed_std`, `premovement_cases_file`, top-level `metadata`
  blocks) were removed from the ZIPs and either moved to reference CSVs /
  `scenario_builders/` modules or scheduled for re-injection inside the
  notebooks. Loader-canonical fields (`use_premovement`, `premovement_*`,
  `max_throughput`, `enable_throughput_throttling`) are kept in the ZIPs.

## Pending NIST tests

The remaining "pending" rows above are blocked on simulator features that are not yet
in the JuPedSim CollisionFreeSpeedModel. Each will be added in a follow-up
PR once the corresponding feature lands.
